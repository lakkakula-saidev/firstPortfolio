    <h1>Animals in the Zoo Rostock</h1>

    <h2>AUSTRALIAN JELLYFISH</h2>

    <p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrfelquallen"><u>The Australian jellyfish</u></a> floats seemingly weightlessly through the water with its blue-spotted bell.A uniform flow in the jellyfish <br>
      kreisel tank at the Darwineum allows it to calmly make its circles. Jellyfish are true survival artists. Without brain, heart and <br>
      skeleton they have managed to survive every continental drift and every climate change. In doing so, the multicellular organisms <br>
      have hardly changed for 500 million years. The Australian jellyfish consists of 99% water and 1% percent is then allotted to diet, <br>
      digestion and reproduction. </p>

      <h2>BORNEAN ORANGUTAN</h2>
      <img src="Orangutan.png" alt="No image found" width= "500">
      <p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo-Orang-Utan"><u>The name orangutan</u></a> originates from Indonesian and means “person of the forest”. The name could hardly be more suitable for the tree <br>
        dweller with the rust-brown coat. So the great apes spend most of the time in their life in the treetops and very seldom climb down <br>
        to the ground. Their body structure is perfectly adapted to this way of life, with long arms and powerful gripper hands and feet for <br>
        clutching branches and trees. The young animals among the orangutans also climb before they are able to walk on the ground.</p>

        <h2>HUMBOLDT PENGUIN</h2>

        <h3>South American penguins wearing ‘tailcoats’</h3>
        <p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt-Pinguin"><u>Humboldt penguins</u></a> belong to the genus of banded penguins. They are about 50-70 centimetres in height and have an average weight of 4 kilograms.<br>
          A black breast band and the black mask are typical of the species. At the same time, the black spots on their white belly are individual <br>
          and vary from animal to animal. While the birds once lived on land and were still able to fly, many millions of years ago they moved into <br>
          water and adapted their body accordingly. Humboldt penguins are excellent swimmers and divers. In the water they reach speeds of up to <br>
          40 km/h and dive down to 20 metres. They can also see very well under water.</p>
