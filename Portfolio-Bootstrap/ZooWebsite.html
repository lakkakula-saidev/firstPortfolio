    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>4,500 animals in 450 different species from all over the world live at the Rostock Zoo in near-natural habitats which are surrounded by <br>
      a unique park landscape. Founded in 1899, the zoo looks back on a long history and has evolved from a former Wildlife and Dendrological <br>
      Garden to become the present-day largest zoo on the German Baltic Sea coast</p>

   <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
  <img src="principles.jpg" alt="No image found" width="1510">
   <h3>Passion</h3>
  <p> We work with full commitment to the animals which have been entrusted to us. They are our passion. We passionately accompany you as a visitor and <br>
  provide you with very special impressions and adventures. In particular, we want to inspire and encourage children to become acquainted with their <br>
  environment and put them into action to protect it. We do our utmost so that the spark of our enthusiasm electrifies you. Catch on to the enthusiasm!</p>

  <h3>Curiosity</h3>
  <p>We are curious about the future and would like to shape it together with you. Walk on unknown paths with us. Marvel at the wonder and treasures of nature <br>
  which provide us with ideas for many new projects. Try things out with intellectual curiosity and spirit of adventure. Knowledge helps to explain and to <br>
  understand. Nature has so much in store for us. Go on a journey of knowledge with us! </p>

  <h3>Diversity</h3>
  We love and live for diversity. Life is a fascinating network: animals and humans, young and old, grey and colourful – so many living environments and worlds <br>
  of experience. We respect and cherish this diversity, and as signatories of the nationwide “Diversity Charter”, also in social interaction with each other. <br>
  We are mindful of an appreciative, impartial environment among visitors, employees and business partners. Immerse yourself and experience the diversity!
